# terminal_app_with_login

Simple terminal app that allows user creation, persistence, and log in / log out functionality with a logged_in_menu_loop() that is only accessible after login and displays user-specific data.

This only provides a framework for adding in more specific relationships/structures/functions/classes, but it gets you off on a good foot!
